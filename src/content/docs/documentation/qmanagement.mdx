hospitals,banks, exchanges, and other service-oriented establishments.

options for customers to check in physically using kiosks or reception desks.

Our queue management system provides real-time online queue status updates
for clients, ensuring transparency and convenience. Clients can access this
information from their smartphones, tablets, or computers via a secure web
portal or mobile app. This feature allows clients to see their position in
the queue, estimated wait times, and any notifications regarding their turn.
By offering this service online, we enhance customer satisfaction by reducing
uncertainty and allowing clients to plan their time effectively.

The system includes live token status updates, displaying current token numbers
being served and those next in line. This real-time display ensures that both
clients and staff can track the progress of the queue efficiently. It reduces
confusion and enhances operational efficiency by providing clear, up-to-date
information to everyone involved. Clients can easily see when their turn is
approaching, minimizing frustration and wait times

and updates directly via WhatsApp. Simply provide your WhatsApp number during
token generation, and notifications about queue status and turn updates will be
